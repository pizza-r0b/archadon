Each of our rugs is a hand-knotted, one-of-a-kind, heirloom-quality piece that will last for generations. In a time when so much of what we consume is machine-made, owning something handcrafted is a point of pride. Not only are these rugs beautiful, they are also beautifully durable. Hand-knotted rugs made from high-quality wool have a denser pile, which means they’re thicker and tougher than any machine-made rug. They’re more stain and soil resistant, and they stand up to foot traffic, so you can put them anywhere in your home.</p>\n\n          <hr className=\"margin--bottom-20\" />\n          <h2 className=\"align--center\">About Us</h2>\n          <p className=\"align--center margin--top-3\">Archadon is an online company based in San Francisco and we ship our rugs from Utah.</p>\n          <p className=\"align--center\">Buy with confidence—learn more about risk-free rug buying with Archadon.</p>\n          <div className=\"flex-parent flex-align-center flex-justify-center margin--top-3\"><Link to=\"/about\" className=\"btn--primary\">Learn More</Link></div>\n          <hr className=\"margin--y-20\" />\n          <h2 className=\"align--center margin--top-6\">Have questions or want to say hello?</h2>\n          <p className=\"align--center margin--top-3\">Email us at hello@archadon.com</p>\n          <hr className=\"margin--y-20\" />\n\n          <h2 className=\"align--center\">Community-focused Giving</h2>\n\n          <p className=\"align--center margin--top-3\">Archadon supports the Nepal Cleft and Burn Center.
